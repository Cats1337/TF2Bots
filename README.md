# TF2Bots
Investigating who owns the Bots (Re-Re-uploaded on GitHub thise time, so Steam can't yeet it into the shadow realm!)

If you'd like to help me add to this guide, please leave a comment with your evidence and I will make sure to credit you unless you want to stay anonymous. If something is incorrect please let me know and I will fix it, I will try to ~~just cross things out~~ if they are incorrect, and put the correct thing after it.
If there are any other additions they will be listed below.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and helping.
