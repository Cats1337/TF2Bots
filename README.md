Investigating who owns the Bots (Re-Re-uploaded on GitHub thise time, so Steam can't yeet it into the shadow realm!)

If you'd like to help me add to this guide, please leave a comment with your evidence and I will make sure to credit you unless you want to stay anonymous. If something is incorrect please let me know and I will fix it, I will try to ~~just cross things out~~ if they are incorrect, and put the correct thing after it.
If there are any other additions they will be listed below.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and helping.

## UPDATE(S):
* Guide was removed for violating guidelines?... Now it's back :)
* Censoring of words
* Format
* Stuff about another bot owner
* Update Review
* Added another main botter
* Info on what cheat is being used, and how it works.
* Bot statistics
* Guide re-re-uploaded, now to github, so I don't have to remake it everytime...

## PLANNED UPDATE(S):
* Xarq0n
* ?

Clearly doing something right if this got reported enough to be taken down.
As well as some of the bot hosters and cheaters commenting on this guide as well as my profile. Just makes me that much more confident in my findings.

So, since Steam doesn't want me to put all this info on Steam it's now on Github, so...


Valve, please fix.
