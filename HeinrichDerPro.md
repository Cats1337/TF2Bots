Bots will spam many different things in chat, one of them being a link to a steam user's profile.
[Profile](https://steamcommunity.com/id/HeinrichDerPro) his profile picture *was* the same up until recently when they changed it.

They have also changed their name since I started writing this informative guide out. For continuity sake I will be referring to him as "HeinrichDerPro"

######In the case they change their url, or name again, here is their info

Using https://steamid.uk/]steamid.uk we can check a user's avatar history, name history, and other information.
Inputting his steamid / url 
[Profile Url](https://steamid.uk/profile/76561198379458763)

We can see that his profile pictures were the same, his original name "NÂ¡~~Redacted~~killer" using an inverted exclamation mark to bypass the filter, and then using various zalgo characters.

Thought it is difficult to see, you can see that the profile picture, or pfp, used to be the same as the "N~~Redacted~~Killer bots.

Though I wasn't able to find the profile link to this specific account, someone named Miata provided me with the image above, as well as some other information.
