Bots will spam many different things in chat, one of them being a link to a steam user's profile.
[Profile](https://steamcommunity.com/id/HeinrichDerPro) his profile picture *was* the same up until recently when they changed it.

They have also changed their name since I started writing this informative guide out. For continuity sake I will be referring to him as "HeinrichDerPro"

#### In the case they change their url, or name again, here is their info
Steam ID | STEAM_0:1:209596517
------------ | -------------
Steam3 | [U:1:419193035]
Community ID | 76561198379458763
Custom URL | heinrichderpro
Url history | https://steamid.uk/url/heinrichderpro
SteamID URL | https://steamid.uk/profile/76561198379458763
Community URL | https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198379458763

Using https://steamid.uk/]steamid.uk we can check a user's avatar history, name history, and other information.
Inputting his steamid / url 
[Profile Url](https://steamid.uk/profile/76561198379458763)

We can see that his profile pictures were the same, his original name "Nยก~~Redacted~~killer" using an inverted exclamation mark to bypass the filter, and then using various zalgo characters.

Thought it is difficult to see, you can see that the profile picture, or pfp, used to be the same as the "N~~Redacted~~Killer bots.

Though I wasn't able to find the profile link to this specific account, someone named Miata provided me with the image above, as well as some other information.

````
"There were many of these. 
The site is hosted by a server in **Germany***¹*. 
That checks as well. 
His whole profile is filled with false information. 
Another check. 
Because he loves the attention. 
The website is used for donations. 
So he can continue running the server with the bots. 
Also he has a lot of famous **cheaters** on his **friends list** *²*. 
That's just another giveaway that he's the one responsible."

###### **Point 1:** 
* The main site was hosted in Germany. *
* HeinrichDerPro is German.
* Bots were/are racist
* HeinrichDerPro has racist past, and present.

* *Though I don't know their host website is, I do believe Miata, unless evidence proves otherwise.*

He legit has a [How to Cheat Guide...] (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2394545944) though it seems satirical, you can't help but think it's all too perfect.

###### **Point 2:**
* Friends with botter(s).
  * Though I don't know all the 'famous' cheaters, I ask that you link me their profiles and I'll update the guide according to information found.

*Thanks to an anonymous user for pointing this out to me.*
