Though I currently don't have their main steam profile, I think, they're nice enough to post youtube videos, like an idiot. From what I've found they have two channels, their [Main Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Impersonator) and the OMEGATRONIC channel. They have some videos of them clearly cheating, and such. As well as their featured / friends channels being hackers. I'm not going to give too deep into them, yet, or maybe wont but who knows.

From what I can find this is their main account, which was VAC banned as of the time I'm writing this, 06/28/2021.

#### In the case they change their url, or name again, here is their info
