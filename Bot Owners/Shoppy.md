Now this is another bot, that we can look at to see how they're getting support. So I chucked on a vpn, and checked out the link bots spam. Which brings you to ~~Redacted~~ They use the word 'boat' in place of 'bot' I'm guessing to prevent shoppy from being suspicious? 
They have two different things listed on their shoppy.

Bot Rental, that's right rental, you don't get the bots forever, you have $60 for a week, you could gamble all that away on cases and get no unusuals for that much...

"Rent boats for whatever you would like. $60 is for one week. Keep in mind, this price is best suited for what you are receiving. You will receive over 100 boats to do this work for you."

### Now to their "immunity"
```That's right, permanent.

You will have to input your Steam32 ID into the custom fields (at checkout) for this to work correctly.

You can use steamid.xyz to grab your steamid (steamid32 ID)

Notes:
There is a betrayal system in use, immunity will be removed upon killing boats.
Betrayals will reset after a set amount of time so no need to rebuy this package.
If the boat has this shoppy link as the disconnect message, and is tier 2, this should work.
REMEMBER! You are not ignored by all bots! You are only ignored to Boat Rolling Incorporated boats, and none others.
      You may have to buy their packages if you would like to be immune to them.
```

* Betrayal sytstem, you kill a bot, they'll kill you again, so it's only "immunity" if you don't touch them...
* Only 'Boat Rolling Incorporated' bots, and they encourage you to buy 'other' bot owners "immunity". Or just another set of their bots.
* Tier 2, does this mean like Tier 2 rank? So their new bots will still kill you regardless...

#### Not only is it a scam, it probably doesn't even work, but I'm not giving them anything to test it, and neither should you... I'm not sure how to report shoppy users, but I don't doubt some of you will go ahead and do it and get their account terminated.

It seems as though these bots are pretty much gone, I haven't seen any recently though.
