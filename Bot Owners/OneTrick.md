Inputting his steamid / url 

They privated their profile, so uh, gottem?
We can see that one of his original name is "OneTrick" and some of their older profile pictures are the same as some of the bots profile pictures.

I also asked 'TheCatsMeow412' if they knew why pretty much all cheaters were bronies and they had no idea either...

I had a nice chat w/ TheCatsMeow412, and while they do still play TF2, ocasionally, when I mentioned the bots, they said "They're back?". Then went on to answer some of my questions, below.

"Okay, well OneTrick is mad at me*¹* for some reason, and is starting some fake drama."
###### **Point 1:**
I used to know him, and idk why hes upset, Calli*²* thinks is cause he wants me back, but noone really knows.
###### **Point 2:**
* A cheater.
* Old friend of OneTrick.

"Well he says its cause someone lied and manipulated him, but thats just some bs and a lie.
I just think its cause he desperate for any form of attention."

They were also kind enough to link me OneTrick's main profile so I can do some more investigation.

They got community banned :D

When I was doing more work on this guide, the sections above. I was getting the screenshots for proof of OneTrick/Dreamy cheating, same person different name. I msg'd TheCatsMeow412 again about the fact that the rest of their screenshots were just pony lewds... 
The following information is about how OneTrick / Dreamy / Timeless is also a pedophile on top of his cheating / botting.

#### Evidence:
First this picture, censored for Victim's privacy:

OneTrick, Dreamy, is talking with someone who wants them to stop botting, and well you can read. The Victim is a minor, shown in video to be 14, and was manipulated into doing a lewd act. Which they never did, thankfully.

Thought DM's are considered to be 'private' unless both participants / parties, agree to keeping them private there is no LEGAL, obligation that they can be held to in the case they disclose / leak their DMs.

Thought this is *not* legal advice, you could easily have a solid case against them. With at least two points

* 1US) Sexual Abuse Offense (Pedophilia) - Maybe 5 years, may vary.
* 2US) Obstruction of Justice (Deleting Evidence) - up to 12 years.

Though OneTrick apparently resides in Canada, from what I've been told, they charges would be the same but different time.

* 1CA) Sexual Abuse Offense (Pedophilia) - Up to 14 years in prison 
* 2CA) Obstruction of Justice (Deleting Evidence) - Up to 10 years, not sure exactly.

I mentioned 'Timeless' above, that is one of the Aliases that OneTrick went by, according to my source, and he did even more questionable and perverted things under that name.

### PSA:
If you are / were sexually assaulted or harassed, please seek proper help from a Trusted adult be it Parent, Teach, Guardian, etc. or call 800-656-HOPE or goto https://www.rainn.org/ to have a live chat with someone who can help you.
