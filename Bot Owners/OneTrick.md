They privated their profile, so uh, gottem?
We can see that one of his original name is "OneTrick" and some of their older profile pictures are the same as some of the bots profile pictures.

I also asked 'TheCatsMeow412' if they knew why pretty much all cheaters were bronies and they had no idea either...

I had a nice chat w/ TheCatsMeow412, and while they do still play TF2, ocasionally, when I mentioned the bots, they said "They're back?". Then went on to answer some of my questions, below.

"Okay, well OneTrick is mad at me*¹* for some reason, and is starting some fake drama."
###### **Point 1:**
I used to know him, and idk why hes upset, Calli*²* thinks is cause he wants me back, but noone really knows.
###### **Point 2:**
* A cheater.
* Old friend of OneTrick.

"Well he says its cause someone lied and manipulated him, but thats just some bs and a lie.
I just think its cause he desperate for any form of attention."

They were also kind enough to link me OneTrick's main profile so I can do some more investigation.
