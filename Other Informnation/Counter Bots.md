Since they are bots and using cheats, there is no way you can out-skill them right. Or is there?

In the video above by avid, he says he was looking up in order to block his head hitbox, and he when he gets shot he doesn't die, due to the bullet hitting his arms and not his head, and then he kills the bot. 
Now how else can you do with these bots you ask? Well, you can kick them, and here's how.

* Type "status" in console. You'll get a printout of the server information such as location, ip, and users connected.
* Next you want to find the bot, look for their username, and on the right side for "spawning" and a connected time of "00:00" are the easiest ways to find the bot. (Highlighted in red, note in blue.)
* Then type "callvote kick #" (Replace # with the bot's userid.) (Highlighted in purple.)

The other way to kick is by press escape, and click call vote, clicking the bot, and calling the vote. But this takes too long and the bot will probably kick you before you can kick it. As well as the other issue of the menu not updating until they are in-game, and have already called a vote on you...

## Bot Detection

If GitHub Coder PazerOP can create a program that detects the bots, and targets them / tells others about them, then why can't Valve do the same?

It's all open source too, so feel free to check it out!
