[This article](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7w87d/meet-the-guy-fixing-team-fortress-2s-bot-problemwith-more-bots) by Vice about Milenko who was the lad who was trying to counter the bots, with bots that targeted bots. Two of the developers who work on CH said they don't plan on changing the code in order to sabotage the anti-bot bots, meaning they're clearly on the cheating side there's other neat little tidbits in the article. 

Valve probably doesn't do what we'd think they do and just go to the github, and write a counter for the code because as mentioned in the article about how the identification works, it's just a game of cat and mouse, Valve updates something, CH updates, Valve updates, etc. and it's an endless loop of back and forth until one of them gives up.

[Milenko (discontinued)](https://milenko.ml),Seems as though the project has sadly been discontinued, the anti-bot lad, has a website where he talks about hoe he does the anti-bot stuff. TF2DB, TF2 Bot Detector, only temporarily adds them to a list for the user, but doesn't detect all bots, that's where "GLaDOS" which is explained more in depth on their website, but simply bots names are collected, and then 'GLaDOS' scans servers for similar names, and adds them to the list. 
Another cool thing about this 'GLaDOS' database is that it's bot public, and there are [live statistics (discontinued)](https://milenko.ml/livestats.html)! I let the statistics page run for abnout 60 minutes, an hour, to see what TF2 consists of, and it's surprising.

### How the Graph is set-up:
* Numbers on the left are total players
* Bottom is time
* Right side has number of bots, and the percentage (which you can ignore as it confuses a little)

### The Datapoints:
* Grey is total players, including bots
* Green is total human players. Which is around 7.7k ~ 7.5k, until a crash occurred, then the data is sort of skewed. 
* Orange is number of bots
* Yellow is it's own stat, being the percent of bots to humans, which is typically 3.5% ~ 4.0%


For about every 28 players, there's one bot...
