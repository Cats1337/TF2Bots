I met this guy in Competitive, and all he did was talk bout how he made a cheat, advertisted it in chat as [buysmurf.win](buysmurf.win) which literally just links to his profile lol. He was charging like $40 I think for this cheat. All he did was spinbot in spawn and brag that he made cheats for Windows & Linux.
